- GCP重Innovation.
- AWS: take care of the undifferentiating heavy-lifting for you.
- GCP: offer you solutions that you couldn't possibly built it yourself.

- GCP: built from dev's side towards ops/infra (Site Reliability Engineering)
- AWS: built from ops/infra's side towards dev.

- Lynn Langit: "Google is such a developer-focused cloud. You code everything first, and then the tools come later, if ever. Even though their cloud is really powerful and scalable, that's just not the paradigm. Whereas AWS is a DevOps cloud, and I think that's been one the drivers of their success, around data in particular, because the network admins and DBAs have more references"
    - 這個comment如何解讀？

- GCP的缺點：“Build by Google, for Google”
    - 這也是他們market的方式 --> use the same technologies Google uses.
    - 不是為一般Enterprise客戶做的
- 因為GCP的市佔率不高，所以"GCP is more willing to be 'a cloud' that you use, not `the cloud` you use."
    - deploy most of the everyday aplications on AWS, and use GCP for special capabilities.

- Purchased services
    - stackdriver
    - Apigee
    - Firebase
- 反而會被感覺無法fit in other services

Other ideas:
- AWS, like Amazon.com, offers a-z
- GCP, like Google's apps, clean & user-focused.
